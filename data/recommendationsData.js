      "“Mo has an air of calm and maturity about him that inspires trust and made him a magnet for his colleagues during the ten month course. He was always willing to engage in tasks and contribute enthusiastically in group scenarios. He is bright, professional, thoughtful and a joy to work with - I would jump at the chance to work with him again.“",

    review: "Exceptional Developer and Collaborator",
    recommendation:
      "“Mo is an enthusiastic and talented developer with a broad range of skills across the stack, from building out aesthetic and functional designs in Figma to the implementation of tickets. He approaches tech with an attention to detail, both visually and in terms of understanding product requirements. He has brought a great deal of value to his peers on the course, as well as to team mates in projects. I had the pleasure of supervising his final team project, and the determination and infectious positive spirit that he brought to proceeding was a huge part in the projects success. I’d have no hesitation to recommend Mo to any product driven engineering team that would benefit from his unique combination of skills and experience.“",

    review: "A Trusted Partner in Creativity and Problem-Solving",
    recommendation:
      "Working with Mo since 2014, at his home, on location, and in the studio... accompanied by a shot of whisky at the end, has been an enjoyable experience. We enjoyed working together, and he's the only person whom I trust fully in terms of imagination, skills, and content judgment! We've also filmed on location, handling impossible live streams with call-ins and camera work, where he was a star in directing and problem-solving within seconds. Believe me, we faced many problems. Now, I take him everywhere I go, even by force. I can't imagine working closely with someone else. The only thing is, give him space to play and create in your stories.",
